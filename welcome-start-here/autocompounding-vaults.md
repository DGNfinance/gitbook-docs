# Autocompounding Vaults

**One of the unique advantages of being in the Dragon Finance ecosystem is that we have our own autocompounding vaults which are designed to maximize your earning potential.**

Staking DGN-BTCB LP, DSHARE-BNB LP, or DGN-DSHARE LP tokens in these vaults rewards you with more of the same LP (liquidity pool) tokens as the ones you have deposited. These deposits happen in the same yield farms that are available to everyone else on Dragon Finance.

But here is where the auto-compounder magic steps in - every set amount of minutes, they harvest the DSHARE that you’ve earned and sell a portion of it automatically. The proceeds are then further used to mint more LP tokens on PancakeSwap which are again deposited into the Dragon Finance autocompounder, further growing your allocation with zero effort on your part.

Note that while this entire process can be done manually, the autocompounder saves you from the hassle of having to schedule and remember specific actions, simplifying the whole process down to a single click and saving you loads in gas fees along the way.

The DGN-BTCB LP, DSHARE-BNB LP, and DGN-DSHARE LP pools pay rewards in DSHARE. If you’re in the DGN-DSHARE or DSHARE-BNB LP pools, 50% of your DSHARE rewards are sold to purchase DGN or BNB respectively each time the protocol auto-compounds. If you’re in the DGN-BTCB pool, 100% of your reward is sold and used to purchase half DGN and half BTCB each time. Unlike the DGN-BTCB or DGN-DSHARE vaults, the DSHARE-BNB vault does not apply any buy pressure on DGN.

To access the Dragon Finance autocompounding vaults, just navigate to our [Autovaults](https://www.bomb.farm/#/bsc) page. If you have any questions about how to use them, check the relevant sections below for the vault you want to use!

One of the great things about our DGN-BTCB LP autovault is that because it is selling DSHARE to purchase both DGN and BTCB automatically every two hours, simply parking your DGN or BTCB in this autovault is all you need to do to add to your Bitcoin holdings automatically over time.

In a bear market, this can be an extremely effective way to automatically DCA into your Bitcoin position and significantly grow your Bitcoin holdings, purely from rewards granted by the vault and without any manual effort.
