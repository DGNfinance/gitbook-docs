# Roadmap

Updates will be posted here as the Roadmap is updated.

&#x20;_Last updated January 26th, 2022_

* [ ] Timelock all contracts. Timelock will be a minimum three-day lock on all contracts which control rewards or any other aspect of how the system functions.
* [x] Run our own BSC full node to provide RPC to our services and community.\
  (Done: https://bsc1.bomb.money)
* [x] Initial website redesign.
* [ ] Complete website revamp to make our core features much easier to understand and to allow for simpler participation in the protocol.
* [x] Complete documentation revamp.
* [x] Autocompounding vaults.
* [ ] Establish partner autocompounding vaults.
* [ ] Run a Bomb Money BSC validator (requires 10,000 BNB).
* [ ] Enable single staking of BTC from BTC main net.
* [ ] Other new and exciting ways for users outside of BSC to participate in our protocol.
* [ ] Shift to a community governed project, where all contracts are owned by a DAO. Project decisions will be voted upon by protocol participants, weighted by their holdings of our governance token (xBOMB). (Currently projected for mid-2022.)
* [ ] Launch BOMB CHAIN with BOMB as our native token. (Currently projected for late 2022.)
