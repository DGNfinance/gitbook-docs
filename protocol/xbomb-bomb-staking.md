# xBOMB - BOMB Staking

### What is xBOMB?

xBOMB is a utility token for the BOMB Money protocol.  To vote on decisions that will shape the future of BOMB Money, xBOMB must be held in your wallet.  The more xBOMB you hold, the more power your vote will carry.

### How Does xBOMB Work?

BOMB can be exchanged to and from xBOMB at anytime on our [xBOMB page](https://app.bomb.money/xbomb).

When xBOMB was launched, the ratio of BOMB to xBOMB was exactly 1.0.  This means that when you deposit 100 BOMB, your receive 100 xBOMB in return.  And when you redeem 100 xBOMB, you would get 100 BOMB.

xBOMB is only minted when BOMB is deposited into the contract.  Anytime BOMB is sent to the xBOMB smart contract as rewards, it will increase the ratio of BOMB to xBOMB, generating a yield for all xBOMB holders.

### Example

John deposits 10,000 BOMB into xBOMB staking, when the exchange is 1.0.  John receives 10,000 xBOMB in return for his 10,000 BOMB.

Other users stake a combined 90,000 additional BOMB, making the total staked amount of BOMB 100,000.

Now we have 100,000 xBOMB in total, and 100,000 BOMB in the xBOMB staking contract.

10,000 BOMB are now sent to the xBOMB reward contract, making the total amount of BOMB in the contract 110,000 now (learn where BOMB rewards come from below).

Since the total amount of xBOMB is still 100,000, but the BOMB shared among stakers is 110,000, the exchange rate(ratio) will now be 1.1 BOMB per xBOMB.

John can now redeem his 10,000 xBOMB, and will receive 11,000 BOMB in return.

All BOMB deposits at this point will receive xBOMB in return at the current exchange of 1.1 (as per this example).

### How Does xBOMB Get Additional BOMB?

There are numerous sources of BOMB for the xBOMB holders:

* Between January 24th and February 7th, 50,000 BOMB will be deposited into the xBOMB smart contract to benefit early stakers.  That is an average of over 3,500 BOMB per day, over $10,000 USD per day!
* 20% of all BOMB minted on expansionary epochs will be deposited for xBOMB holders.  This comes from the protocols BOMB allocation and has no impact on BSHARE staking.
* 80% of all fees collected from the autocompounding vaults will be used to buy BOMB on the open market and deposited for xBOMB holders.
