![The Dragon Finance farms currently available for staking LP tokens to earn DSHARE rewards](<../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Dragon Finance protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with DSHARE to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total DSHARE rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* DSHARE-BNB LP: 40% of DSHARE rewards
* DRAGON-DSHARE LP: 60% of DSHARE rewards

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of DSHARE (59.5K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly one year from when the DSHARE farms started on November 25th, 2021. DSHARE will always continue to print DRAGON in the Boardroom, though, as long as DRAGON remains above peg.

{% hint style="danger" %}
DSHARE reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on November 25th, 2022 once the total DSHARE supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When DRAGON is pegged or close to being pegged at 100 DRAGON to 1 BNB, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if BNB pumps, DRAGON pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If BNB pumps in price, it won't "outrun" DRAGON, even if nobody is buying DRAGON at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If BNB rises in USD value, DRAGON goes with it. Similarly, if BNB falls in USD value, DRAGON will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The only thing that can change the price of DRAGON in terms of its BNB value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
