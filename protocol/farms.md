# Farms

![The Dragon Finance farms available on three sections to earn DGN and DSHARE rewards](<../.gitbook/assets/farm.png>)

## DSHARE reward pool
To incentivize healthy liquidity pools for the Dragon Finance protocol tokens, our LP farms have been seeded with DSHARE to be distributed as rewards to LP stakers across a time period of 12 months. The total DSHARE rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:

* DGN-BNB LP: 40% of DSHARE rewards
* DSHARE-BNB LP: 60% of DSHARE rewards

## DGN reward pool
140,000 DGN tokens already distributed on DGN reward pool. It will run for 9 days from on March 14th 2022.

* 80,000 DGN token will be distributed to DGN-BNB LP stakers for first 4 days
* 60,000 DGN tokens will be distributed to DGN-BNB LP stakers for next 5 days

## Genesis reward pool
Genesis pool will run for 2 days from on March 13th 2022.
The DGN rewards are distributed from each farm as follows:
* WBNB: 40% of DGN rewards
* BUSD: 30% of DGN rewards
* USDC: 30% of DGN rewards

### **1. What will happen when the circulating supply equals the total supply? Will reward emissions stop?**

Yes. Once the max supply of DSHARE (59.5K) is reached, reward emissions end. This will happen in exactly one year from when the DSHARE farms will start on March 14th, 2022. DSHARE will always continue to print DGN in the Boardroom, though, as long as DGN remains above peg.

DSHARE reward emissions for the current LP farms are scheduled to end on March 13th, 2023 once the total DSHARE supply has been distributed.

### 2. Why is "at-peg" (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?

When DGN is pegged or close to being pegged at 100 DGN to 1 BNB, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. Wait, you mean that if BNB pumps, DGN pumps with it?

**Yes!**\
\
Let's look at an example:\
\
If BNB pumps in price, it won't "outrun" DGN, even if nobody is buying DGN at that time.\
\
The farm APRs will vary in terms of USD value, but the emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stablecoin LP position, where the USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If BNB rises in USD value, DGN goes with it. Similarly, if BNB falls in USD value, DGN will be worth less in USD, **but it won’t affect the peg**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The only thing that can change the price of DGN in terms of its BNB value (and as such, the peg) is buying and selling it.
