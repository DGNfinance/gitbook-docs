# Roadmap

Updates will continue to be posted.  Items with ~~strikethrough~~ have already been completed.

* Timelock all contracts.  Timelock will be a minimum 3 day lock on all contracts which control rewards, or any aspect of how the system functions.
* ~~Run our own BSC full node to provide RPC to our services and community.~~
  * Already done: https://bsc1.bomb.money
* ~~Website redesign~~
* Complete website re-work to make our core features much easier to understand and allow simpler participation
* Autocompounding vaults
  * ~~Initially, we will launch our own auto compounding vaults, so our users can enjoy those benefits immediately~~
  * We will get auto compound vaults with partners in the future
* Run a bomb.money BSC Validator - requires 10,000 BNB
* New and exciting ways for users outside of BSC to participate in our protocol - details to follow.
* Mid 2022 -  shift to a community governed project, where all contracts will be owned by a DAO.  Project decisions will be decided upon by protocol participants
* Late 2022 - Launch BOMB CHAIN with BOMB as central currency.
