# FAQ / Getting Started

## Getting Started

### 1.“Generally speaking, what's the easiest flow to follow for compounding rewards?”

The following is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. It is for education and entertainment purposes only.&#x20;

There are countless strategies, and which one you choose depends on your risk tolerance and short, medium, and long-term goals. That being said, the "plug-and-play" method is detailed below. Also, take some profits along the way. Don't get too greedy.

**If $BOMB is OVER the peg:**

\-Buy $BOMB and pair it with $BTC to provide liquidity, and stake your BOMB-BTCB LP in the farm to earn $BSHARE rewards.\
\-Take your $BSHARE rewards and stake them in the Boardroom to earn inflationary $BOMB rewards.\
\-Sell half of your earned $BOMB for $BTCB, and compound it back into the BOMB-BTCB LP.\
\-Profit!

#### **If $BOMB is UNDER the peg:**

1.Buy BOMB and exchange it for BBOND. If you are LP'ing, you can break the LP to exchange $BOMB for $BBOND, and use the remaining $BTCB to buy $BOMB to also exchange for $BBOND. Now you have a big fat bag of $BBOND, and you've also helped bring $BOMB back above peg so that the Boardroom can resume printing.

2.Sell $BBOND for a redemption bonus once $BOMB is back over peg (above 1.1 TWAP).

3.Profit.

### 2. "What is 50/50?"

50/50 is the method best suited to provide stability for both the platform and for your underlying investment. By boosting liquidity, the 50/50 strategy reduces price volatility, and helps $BOMB stay above the peg for longer to keep the Boardroom printing. This, in turn, attracts new investors and keeps the ecosystem growing. \
\
1\)When you claim your $BOMB rewards in the Boardroom, sell 50% of them for $BTCB. \
\
&#x20;2\)When you go to provide BOMB-BTCB LP,  stake the entirety of your remaining BOMB with the $BTCB you've just purchased.&#x20;

### 3.“There's so many auto-compounding vaults, what should I do?”

We are in the process of getting setup with auto compounding vaults.  The following advice will apply once we have them setup.

If you are in a $BOMB-BTCB LP auto-compounding vault like Beefy Finance, you are creating buy pressure on $BOMB. If you are in a $BSHARE-BNB LP auto-compounding vault and you also hold $BSHARE elsewhere, the auto-compounding vault will be suppressing its price since it is continuously selling $BSHARE. &#x20;



### 4. "APR is much higher in the Boardroom than in the farm for BOMB-BTCB LP. Why would I not just invest everything there?"

The farm APR is linear and prints 24/7, regardless of Bomb's relation to the peg. Boardroom, on the other hand, prints only when BOMB's TWAP is above 1.01. Therefore, it may not always be that an investor gets a higher return from the Boardroom than from the BOMB-BTCB pool.\
\
Because $BOMB follows the price of $BTC, the BOMB-BTCB LP is akin to holding $BTC in your wallet, except with the bonus of a high farming APR on top of it. In other words, if you're bullish on $BTC's price action, the BOMB-BTCB LP is a way of holding exposure to that single asset while also reaping high APRs.



### Terms and Mechanisms

### 1. "What is an expansionary epoch?"

&#x20;**** An expansionary epoch is the amount of $BOMB that is printed by $BSHARE in order to increase the total circulating supply.

To simplify the explanation with a hypothetical example, let’s say an epoch is 3 days long and there are $100 dollars in the circulating supply.

&#x20;If the money printer grows the supply by 10% of the existing circulating supply each day, at the end of the 3 days you'd have 100\*1.1\*1.1\*1.1 = $133.

&#x20;Then, let’s say the emissions decrease to 5% per day.

&#x20;You’d then have have $133 \*1.05 \*1.05 \*1.05 = $153 at the end of this second epoch.

### **2. “What is compounding in the context of bomb.money?”**

Earning a return on gains you've already made from previous periods is what is commonly referred to as compounding.

&#x20;For example, consider a 3% daily APR on an initial investment of $100.

&#x20;After 24 hours it would grow to $103.

&#x20;After 365 days without compounding: $1195.

&#x20;After 365 days, compounding once daily: $4,848,272.

## Core Values

### 1. “I'm invested in the project for the long term, and I feel guilty taking profits. Am I still a team player if I move profits somewhere outside of the project?”

Never put all your funds in one basket, even if it's $BOMB. Always take gains along the way. The BOMB team views it as a success if, over time, everyone gets their initial investment back into their wallets and continues investing with the profits that come after that.
