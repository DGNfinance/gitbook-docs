# Boardroom

### **1.“Once BBONDS are emitted, does the Boardroom stop printing $BOMB until we are above peg again?”**

&#x20;Staking $BSHAREs will give you $BOMB rewards when the price of $BOMB is above the peg (10,000 BOMB : 1 BTC), but not when it is under the peg.

### **2. “What happens if I interact with the Boardroom in any way?”**

&#x20;Any interaction with the boardroom will reset both timers. That's 3 epochs (18 hours) to withdraw your BOMB rewards, and 6 epochs to unstake your Bshare (36 hours).

### **3. “Are the Boardroom rewards pro-rated by time? I.e if I stake three hours before the end of an epoch vs five hours before the end of an epoch, do I get different rewards?”**

No, it's determined by how much you have staked at the time of printing (i.e. end of one epoch and start of the other). It doesn't matter if you stake 3 hours before or 30 seconds before the emissions occur.

### 4. "If I remove my $BSHARE from Boardroom without first collecting my $BOMB, will it be lost forever?"

No, it will still be there to collect whenever you need.

### 5. "The Boardroom APR dropped because we're in a 'debt phase.' What does this mean?"

A debt phase takes place on the expansion epochs that start after a contraction period where there are still $BBOND to be redeemed.

65% of Expansion during Debt Phase is allocated to the Treasury Fund to prepare for the BBOND Redemption. This amount is still reserved  whether or not BBOND holders are redeeming bonds or not.

Once BOMB in treasury is sufficiently full to meet all circulating bond redemption, expansion rates will resume to normal.

### 6. "If we're in a debt phase, how long will it last until the Boardroom continues printing as normal?"

The debt phase will last as long as is necessary to adequately pay back outstanding $BBOND debt. Please keep in mind that the DAO will also need to collect a little extra, as there needs to be a cushion to cover the bonuses when people redeem $BBOND over peg.\
\
There's no exact way of calculating how many epochs it takes, since we don't know exactly when people will redeem their $BBOND. If the debt phase is ended too early, and then the treasury doesn't have enough $BOMB to repay the $BBOND bonus, then the APR restriction would need to be turned back on.

### 7. "At the end of the epoch, the Boardroom did not print $BOMB, and then no $BBOND(s) were issued. Why?"

There is a balanced state "at peg" when $BOMB's TWAP is between 1.00 and 1.01, and this means there is neither contraction nor inflation.

### 8. "If BOMB continues climbing above the price of the peg, will that influence how long the debt epoch lasts?"

Depending on the price of BOMB, the Boardroom print will have to adjust to provide a buffer for any unclaimed BBOND. As the price of BOMB climbs above the peg, more BOMB needs to be distributed to the treasury to account for BBOND bonus redemption.
