# Contractions & BBOND

### 1. "When can I swap $BOMB for $BBOND?"

$BBOND will only become available in the Pit following epochs in which the Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) of $BOMB is under peg. This means that $BOMB's price will have had to have been under 1 $BTC per 10,000 BOMB for the majority of the previous epoch in order to trigger the Pit to "open".

The Pit will always open at the very beginning of a new epoch, and remain open for the entire epoch — the Pit can not and will never open mid-epoch — and during epochs in which the Pit is open, $BOMB will not be printed in the boardroom.

### 2. "What is the formula to calculate the redemption bonus for $BBOND?"

To encourage redemption of $BBOND for $BOMB when $BOMB's TWAP > 1.1, and in order to incentivize users to redeem at a higher price, $BBOND redemption will be more profitable with a higher $BOMB TWAP value. The $BBOND to $BOMB ratio will be 1:R, where R can be calculated in the formula as shown below:

$$
R=1+[(BOMBtwapprice)-1)*coeff)]
$$

$$
coeff = 0.7
$$

To further illustrate why the longer you hold $BBOND the more profitable it is, let's take an initial $1000 investment into consideration. In this example, say this $1000 is used to buy $BOMB when $BOMB TWAP is 0.95 and then swapped for $BBOND.\
\
If these $BBOND are redeemed when:\
\-$BOMB TWAP is 1.5, your investment would now be worth $1421.\
\-$BOMB TWAP is 2, your investment would now be worth $1789.\
\-$BOMB TWAP is 3, your investment would now be worth $2526.\
\-$BOMB TWAP is 5, your investment would now be worth $4000.\
\


### 3. "I expected $BBOND to be issued in the pit, but there is none. Why?"

There is a balanced state "at peg" when $BOMB's TWAP is between 1.00 and 1.01, and this means there is neither contraction nor inflation.

### 4. "When can I swap $BBOND back to $BOMB?"

You can swap it back again when the following two criteria are met:

1: $BOMB TWAP is above peg and

2\. There is enough in the treasury to cover it the redemption.&#x20;

### 5. "Is $BBOND right for me?"

Like anything else in crypto, obtaining $BBOND is not risk-free. Just like in the real world, you are purchasing debt from the protocol with the expectation that you will be redeemed at a premium in the future. To date, this has occurred after all contractions, but past performance does not guarantee the same future outcomes. \
\
$BBOND is ideal for those with a medium to long-term time preference, as it incentivizes hodling in exchange for potentially extremely lucrative rewards. If you are looking for a quick flip or have short-term time preference, $BBOND may not be the right investment option for you.
