# Farms

### **1.“What will happen when circulating supply = Total supply? Will emissions stop?”**

Yes. Once the max supply of $BSHARE (59.5K) is reached, emissions stop. This is going to be in a year from when the $BSHARE farms start November 25th. $BSHARE will always print $BOMB in the Boardroom, though, as long as $BOMB is above peg.



### 2.“Why is ‘at-peg’ (TWAP between 1.00 and 1.01) the best time to provide liquidity?”

When $BOMB is pegged or close to being pegged to 10,000 BOMB : 1 BTC, it is more akin to having exposure to a single asset (single staking) than to your traditional LP'ing experience, where you would run the risk of impermanent loss if one of the tokens went up in value and the other did not.

### 3. "Wait, you mean that if $BTC pumps, $BOMB pumps with it?"

Yes!\
\
Let's take an example:\
\
If $BTC pumps in price, it won't 'outrun' $BOMB.\
\
The APR will vary in terms of its $USD value, but emissions won’t. This is something that wouldn't be possible with another 1:1 pegged asset like a stable coin LP position, where the $USD value is directly tied to the emissions. If $BTC rises in $USD value, $BOMB goes with it. Same if $BTC falls in $USD value, $BOMB will be worth less in $USD, but it won’t affect the peg. The only thing that can change the price of $BOMB in terms of its $BTC value is buying and selling it.
