# Rewards

### 1. “How can I figure out what my future $BOMB rewards will be from the Boardroom?”

Simplified example for a _non-debt phase_: say you have 1 $BSHARE staked out of 10 total $BSHAREs staked in Boardroom, so you will get 10% of the total $BOMB emissions.&#x20;

So, for this example we are assuming that there is a total circulating supply of 10,000 $BOMB, the current expansion rate is at 4%, and therefore 400 $BOMB will be emitted. \
\
You would get ((0.04 _\* 10000) \*_ 0.6) \* (1/10) = 24 $BOMB.\
\
With current regulations, this is the distribution breakdown:\
\-60% of printed $BOMB goes to $BSHARE stakers.\
\-30% goes to treasury account.  This is to fund the growth of the protocol and have funds for future incentivized activities.  Until project is 100% controlled by the community, the devs will do what they feel is in the best interest of the protocol with these funds.\
\-10% goes to the devs. These funds can be used any way the dev wishes, but will often go back into the protocol.

Formula to calculate your rewards: ((ExpansionRate \* _CirculatingBOMBSupply)_ \* 0.6) \* (YourBShareStake/TotalBShareStaked)

### 2. “How long will it take for BSHARE to pay itself off from $BOMB rewards, based on current prices?”

This will vary constantly as the APR in the boardroom fluctuates, along with other variables such as the price of $BOMB.

&#x20;For a quick estimation, however, you can do the following:

&#x20;  1) Take the total APR shown in the boardroom, and divide that by 365 to get the daily APR. (In this example, we will say the daily APR is 5%.) 

&#x20;2\) Multiply that daily APR by the current market price of the total Bshare you have staked to see what your daily rewards are.(In this example, we have 5 Bshares, each worth $500, for a total amount staked of $2500. Your daily return is $2500 \* .05, which comes out to $125/day.)

  3)Take your initial buy-in price for Bshares, and divide it by your daily rewards. If you bought these 5 Bshares at a higher price of $700, for example, in the current market conditions you will recover your initial investment ($3500) in 3500/125 = 28 days.

### **3. “Does a higher TVL mean a higher APR?”**

The more TVL in the pool, the less APR (there's more people getting the same piece of the pie), but the higher the price of the reward (the pie) the higher the APR (better quality of pie). In other words, although the same rewards are diluted across more investors, if those rewards have a higher dollar value because of the increase in TVL, then it can actually lead to a higher APR as well.
