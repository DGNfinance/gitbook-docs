# Big Picture

The $BOMB algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and new use cases to the BSC network.\
\
The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $BOMB's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $BTC.

Inspired by tomb.finance, who was originally inspired by the idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), bomb.money is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens:\
\-bomb.money ($BOMB).\
\-BOMB Shares ($BSHARE)\
\-BOMB Bonds ($BBOND).

## What differentiates $BOMB from other algorithmic tokens?

Unlike previous algorithmic tokens, $BOMB is not pegged to a stable coinâ€” it is instead pegged to $BTC. &#x20;

Because of BTCs high per coin price, we have decided to peg BOMB to BTC at a 10,000:1 ratio.  In other words, 10,000 BOMB should equal 1 BTC for our PEG to be maintained.\


One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the BOMB team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.
