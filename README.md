Welcome to bomb.money!

### Origins

After falling in love with the tomb.finance project on Fantom, it was hard to believe that nothing like this existed on the other networks.  BSC seemed like a great choice to launch a tomb.finance fork with a few twists, so here we are!

### Thanks to TOMB.finance

This project would not be possible without the excellent work from the [tomb.finance](https://tomb.finance) team.  Their project being fully open source and developed exceptionally well made it a pleasure to work with.  Can't say enough good things about the TOMB team.

Having said that, much of this documentation will be copied from TOMB.  Since their code was so great, there was not much need for change besides our PEG and naming conventions.
